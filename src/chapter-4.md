AI, or artificial intelligence, refers to the use of machine learning algorithms and computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and pattern recognition.

Chatbots are software programs that use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. They can be programmed to perform a wide range of tasks, from answering customer service questions to providing gameplay tips and recommendations.

In the gaming industry, AI and chatbots can be used to improve in-game decision making, provide real-time support and guidance to players, enhance immersion, and improve game development and maintenance efficiency.
