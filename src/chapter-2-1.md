They collaborate with game developers to fund game development, handle production logistics, coordinate marketing campaigns, and ensure the game's availability across various platforms and regions.

### Distributors

Distributors are responsible for facilitating the physical or digital distribution of games to retailers or directly to consumers. They manage the logistics of shipping physical copies of games to retailers or handle the distribution of digital game codes through online platforms, enabling players to access and purchase games easily.
